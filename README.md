# My Favorite Talks

An ongoing list of my favorite programming talks


#### Preface

Books, articles, & blog posts are all great. The amount of detail that can be packed into written language is incredible. However, in my opinion, when it comes to learning new concepts & considering alternative points of view, nothing comes close to being able to hear AND see a person express themselves at the same time. Hand gestures, body language, facial expressions, the emotion in the voice, the natural inflections & emphasis put on carefully chosen words... These are the things that really strike a chord with me and help me to understand the intention of the speaker. I love watching talks on programming, and I believe watching talks from speakers who come from different backgrounds, who use different programming languages & different tools, who have fundamentally different perspectives, etc. is the absolute best way to expand the mind and get better insight into the art & science that is software development.

Below is a list of  speakers & talks I have watched which have personally resonated with me in some meaningful way, whether it be emotionally, technically, or philosophically. This list will be continually updated as I discover new talks.
